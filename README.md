# cybertips

##This project was developed as part of my thesis degree. 
##I conducted research aimed at enhancing awareness and promoting good practices among university employees. One aspect of my research involved implementing simulated phishing campaigns using Gophish, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create realistic phishing email and landing templates.
##In addition, I developed a comprehensive cybersecurity awareness website for the university. The website, called Cybertips, was built using Python, Django framework, CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Its purpose was to educate employees about self-defense techniques and provide guidance on safe online navigation.
